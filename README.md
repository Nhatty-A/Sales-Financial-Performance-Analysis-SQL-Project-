# 📊 Sales & Financial Performance Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a retail sales dataset to uncover financial performance trends, product insights, and customer behavior using SQL.  
The goal is to demonstrate practical SQL skills applied to real-world business and financial questions, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and product performance evaluation.

The project simulates a scenario where a data analyst supports business decision-making using transactional sales data.

## 🗂 Dataset
**Source:** Sample Sales Dataset (Kaggle-inspired retail sales data)

**Description:**  
The dataset contains transactional sales records with information on:
- Orders and revenue
- Products and pricing
- Customers and geography
- Time (year, quarter, month)

**Key Columns:**
- `ORDERNUMBER`, `ORDERDATE`, `YEAR_ID`, `MONTH_ID`
- `SALES`, `QUANTITYORDERED`, `PRICEEACH`
- `PRODUCTLINE`, `PRODUCTCODE`
- `CUSTOMERNAME`, `COUNTRY`
- `DEALSIZE`, `STATUS`

## ❓ Business Questions Answered
1. What is the total revenue generated by the company?
2. How does revenue trend over time (yearly and monthly)?
3. Which product lines generate the most revenue?
4. Who are the top customers by revenue contribution?
5. How is revenue distributed across countries and regions?
6. What is the average order value (AOV)?
7. How does deal size impact total revenue?
8. Which customers and products contribute most to overall sales?

## 📈 Key Insights
- Revenue shows clear seasonal and monthly patterns across years  
- Certain product lines consistently outperform others in total revenue  
- A small number of customers contribute a significant share of total sales  
- Large deal sizes generate the highest revenue despite fewer transactions  
- Revenue concentration varies significantly by country and region  

These insights can help businesses optimize pricing strategies, focus on high-value customers, and improve product planning.

## 🛠 SQL Techniques Used
- Data aggregation (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- Grouping and filtering (`GROUP BY`, `WHERE`)
- Sorting and ranking (`ORDER BY`)
- Window functions (`RANK()`, `LAG()`)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Time-based analysis (yearly & monthly trends)
- Business KPI calculations (Total Revenue, AOV, YoY Growth)
